Post:

yo whats up everyone

so i got tired of the hotbar being stuck in one spot and taking up space when i didnt need it. made this little module that lets you drag stuff around.

what it does:
- drag your hotbar wherever you want
- drag the left toolbar thing 
- drag the player list
- minimize buttons so you can hide stuff when you dont need it
- remembers where you put everything

theres also a GM hub (ctrl+alt+n) where you can turn features on/off for yourself or your players

its free, made for v13 but also works on v11-12

install link:
